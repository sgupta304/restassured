Feature: Validate Switch Device Functionality

  @SwitchDevice @HealthCheck @Regression
  Scenario: Validate a successful switch device full flow (smoke test)
    When I generate a mobile GBP SessionId with airlineCode = "DAL", tailNumber = "0DAL2", and deviceMacAddress = "random" and store it at "uxdid"
    And I send a CloudDao GET request to "/v2/token/%{uxdid}"
    Then the response status should be "200"
    And the JSON response at "uxdId" should be "%{uxdid}"
    When I send an APIDecorator GET request to "/v2.1/products/%{uxdid}?locale=en_US&currency=USD"
    Then the response status should be "200"
    And I save the position in collection "plans" of "title" = "Flight Pass" at "position"
    And I save the JSON at "plans[%{position}].productCode" as "productCode"
    And I save the JSON at "plans[%{position}].price" as "price"
    Given I generate a guest purchase object for productCode = "%{productCode}", price = "%{price}", email = "random", and uxdId = "%{uxdid}"
    And I save the generated JSON at "email" as "email"
    When I send an APIDecorator POST request to "/v2/guestpurchase/" with the generated body
    Then the response status should be "200"
    When I send a STUB GET request to "/abp/page/aaaActivate.do?gbpsessionid=%{uxdid}"
    Then the response status should be "200"
    When I send an APIDecorator GET request to "/v2/switchdevice/%{uxdid}"
    Then the response status should be "200"
    And I save the JSON at "switchDeviceCode" as "switchDeviceCode"
    When I generate a mobile GBP SessionId with airlineCode = "DAL", tailNumber = "0DAL2", and deviceMacAddress = "random" and store it at "uxdid2"
    And I send a CloudDao GET request to "/v2/token/%{uxdid2}"
    Then the response status should be "200"
