Feature: Validate GOL Bypass 30 minute PROD

  @HealthCheck
  Scenario: Validate that GOL has bypass for 30 minutes and all session info is correct for bypass promotion
    When I generate a LAPTOP GBP SessionId with airlineCode = "GLO", tailNumber = "GXXXX", and deviceMacAddress = "random" and store it at "uxdid"
#    And I send a CloudDao GET request to "/v2/token/%{uxdid}"
#    Then the response status should be "200"
#    And the JSON response at "uxdId" should be "%{uxdid}"
#    And I save the JSON at "simpleDeviceInfo.clientIp" as "ipAddress"
#    And I save the JSON at "simpleDeviceInfo.macAddress" as "macAddress"
    Given I generate a bypass status object for airline with code: "GLO" and tail: "GXXXX"
    When I send an IFSUTILS POST request to "/v1/bypassrule/status" with the generated body
    Then the response status should be "200"
    And the JSON response at "bypass_enabled" should be "true"
    And I save the JSON at "tail_bypass_rules[0].redirect_url" as "redirect_url"
    And I save the JSON at "tail_bypass_rules[0].active_users" as "active_users"
    And I save the JSON at "bypass_user" as "bypass_user"
    And I save the JSON at "tail_bypass_rules[0].airline_code" as "airline_code"
    Given I generate a bypass promotion token with the following attributes:
      | promotion_name | nissan          |
      | redirect_url   | %{redirect_url} |
      | active_users   | %{active_users} |
      | bypass_user    | %{bypass_user}  |
      | airline_code   | %{airline_code} |
      | tail_number    | GXXXX           |
    When I send a GBP POST request to "/promobypasstoken" with the generated body
    Then the response status should be "200"
    And I save the JSON at "token" as "token"
    When I send an APIDecorator GET request to "/v2/captcha/math/%{uxdid}"
    Then the response status should be "200"
    And I save the JSON at "captchaValue" as "captchaValue"
    And I validate captcha stored at "captchaValue" and store the result at "captchaResult"
    Given I generate a bypass captcha validation object for uxdid: "%{uxdid}" with captchaValue: "%{captchaResult}"
    When I validate captcha for bypass with the cookie: "%{token}"
    Then the response status should be "200"
    When I send a STUB GET request to "/abp/page/aaaActivate.do?gbpsessionid=%{uxdid}"
    Then the response status should be "200"
    When I retrieve user session info with uxdId: "%{uxdid}"
    Then the response status should be "200"
    And the XML response should be the following:
      | java.object.void[0]                | true                           |
#      | java.object.void[1].object.void[0] | %{ipAddress}                   |
      | java.object.void[1].object.void[1] | bypass                         |
      | java.object.void[1].object.void[2] | BYPASS                         |
      | java.object.void[1].object.void[3] | %{uxdid}                       |
      | java.object.void[1].object.void[4] | BYPASS_15M/GLO_nissan/%{uxdid} |
#      | java.object.void[2]                | %{macAddress}                  |
